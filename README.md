## Introduction

The coding exercises and mini-projects in this repository cover various topics, such as data structures, algorithms, design patterns, web development, and more. Each exercise and project should contain a detailed description of the problem, example inputs and outputs, and test cases.

By working on these exercises and projects, I will learn new concepts and programming languages, and also gain valuable experience that can be applied to real-world projects.

## Languages
